# Pet-Adoption-Project
Final Project for my C# class
Created a Pet Adoption Database and then a C# Program for customers & employees
Customers can search for dogs, create an account, login, Adopt a dog, check statistics on breeds
Employees do everything a customer can + add, modify, and delete dogs from database, approve/deny adoption applications and control users as well
Once a dog is adopted the user will get an email congradulating them.
